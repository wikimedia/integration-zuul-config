      "message": "For extensions intended to be deployed to Wikimedia production, the composer dependencies have to be added to mediawiki/vendor.  We thus use the CI template \"extension-quibble\" which does not run \u0027composer install\u0027 but clones mediawiki/vendor instead.\n\nIt is not forced though, but it is usually a good thing to have to prevent deploying an extension which would miss the dependency in mediawiki/vendor.",

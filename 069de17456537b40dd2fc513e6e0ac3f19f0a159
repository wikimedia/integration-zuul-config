Wikimedia has phased out that project as far as I understand it and the repo hasn\u0027t got any update in two years.\n\nProbably it should be archived.  Maybe we can try filling a task to ask archiving it and add whoever knows what OfflineContentGenerator is for.",

      "message": "That is a commit of composer dependencies for the Donation interface extension. DonationInterface as a more specific job because it has to be tested with the REL1_27 branch.\n\nSupposedly, we would need to adjust that job to use the DonationInterface/vendor repository instead of downloading dependencies from composer. Then we would trigger the job on both repo (DonationInterface and DonationInterface/vendor).\n\nThat should be done in a different patch/change and it is a bit more complicated to achieve.  We probably want a subtask in Phabricator and talk to Wikimedia fundraising tech team about it.",

      "message": "operations-mw-config-composer-test-docker is based on HHVM and  runs jakub-onderka/php-parallel-lint  . The hhvmlint job is thus redundant.\n\nI would like to get rid of the php lint jobs, they are an artifact that pre date our adoption of php-parallel-lint and run on permanent slaves which I would like to phase out.\n\nThe repository already has a \"lint\" script which runs parallel-lint. I propose:\n\n* we switch composer test to be run under php7.0\n* we add a job that runs \u0027composer run lint\u0027 using hhvm.\n\n\nSide note: are we sure we no more use php5.5?",

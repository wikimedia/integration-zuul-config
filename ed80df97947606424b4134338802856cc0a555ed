      "message": "operations-mw-config-composer-test-docker is based on HHVM and  runs jakub-onderka/php-parallel-lint  . The hhvmlint job is thus redundant.\n\nI would like to get rid of the php lint jobs, they are an artifact that pre date our adoption of php-parallel-lint and run on permanent slaves which I would like to phase out.\n\nThe repository already has a \"lint\" script which runs parallel-lint. I propose:\n\n* we switch composer test to be run under php7.0\n* we add a job that runs \u0027composer run lint\u0027 using hhvm.\n\n\nSide note: are we sure we no more use php5.5?",

      "message": "Yes, we\u0027re sure :) Anything running MW master on \u003c\u003d PHP 5.6 will fatal as of a few months ago.\n\nRegarding the composer job, I agree we should get rid of the lint jobs, and just run the composer-test fully twice, for HHVM and PHP 7. That makes it much simpler I think.\n\nBut, I don\u0027t want to block this change on that, and I\u0027m not sure how to do that without changing docker files as well, instead of just jobs.\n\nModifying the existing code I hope is not a problem, so I\u0027m going ahead with this. But let\u0027s sync up on IRC about how to improve it further?",

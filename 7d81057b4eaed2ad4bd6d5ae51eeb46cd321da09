Notably that the composer.json file has a name among other things.\n\nHowever, the MediaWiki extensions are not published to packagist and the quibble jobs run:  composer validate --no-check-publish\n\nSo I would rather drop that validation.  If there is an intent to build a standalone library (ie: code which is not a MediaWiki extension), I would rather have a standalone library under eg mediawiki/libs/",

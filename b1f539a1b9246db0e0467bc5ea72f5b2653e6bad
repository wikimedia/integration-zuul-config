So there is no need to load any env there.\n\nInstead you want to generate jobs that will be triggered on patch proposal on either repos like its is done in jjb/parsoidsvc.yaml :\n\n - project:\n     name: parsoidsvc\n     # job templates are shared by both repositories\n     repository:\n      - source  # mediawiki/services/parsoid\n      - deploy  # mediawiki/services/parsoid/deploy\n     jobs:\n         \u003csnip\u003e\n         - \u0027parsoidsvc-{repository}-npm-0.10\u0027",

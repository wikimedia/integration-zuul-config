      "message": "We would need the beta cluster instance to be made a Jenkins slave which is a two step process:\n\n1) in puppet include a bunch of classes to install the requisites. See manifests/role/cxserver.pp which includes contint::firewall::labs role::ci::slave::labs::common \n\n2) Register the instance as a Jenkins slave in Jenkins. That is done manually by creating a new computer from https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/computer/ .  The easiest would be to duplicate the computer deployment-cxserver03 , change the IP address and save.",

It will be triggered once the change is merged and you probably want to skip lint/tests and the emulator entirely to speed up the building.\n\nThat will create the .apk for you  AFTER the change has merged and you can then retrieve it from Jenkins :-}  The artifacts publisher would just copy the .apk / meta.json.\n\nLater we can have a look at publishing it under https://integration.wikimedia.org/ :-D",

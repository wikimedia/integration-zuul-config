      "message": "Jobs prefixed with mwgate- are solely for mediawiki extensions and skins. That is to get changes made on them to depend on each other when one CR+2.\n\nThe -jessie jobs are run on labs instances being discarded (Nodepool) which is legacy. When possible we switch to use a Docker container instead when one exist.\n\nAnd there is one! So you can replace the jobs with:\n\n - composer-php70-docker\n\n\nLastly, postmerge is run after a change has been submitted / merged in the repository.  That would happen after a user has voted CR+2, the job enter gate-and-submit and if the job pass the change get merged.\n\nSince we know the job passed, there is no need to run it again after the change got merged :]",

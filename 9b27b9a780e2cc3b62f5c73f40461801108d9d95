      "message": "Ideally we would use the debian-glue job, but that looks like a restore of the previous job so we can let it in and refactor later.\n\n\nRegardless I think that job got removed because the .deb package was broken or kept breaking scap on beta.  But Mukunda would know more.\n\n\nCan you please split this to a different change?",

I would rather\n \u003e use the tox-docker template for now.\n\nIt\u0027s not going to be deployed via k8s; however, using the test pipeline is still possible/easy. In this way we avoid an additional dockerfile in the dockerfiles directory that is just a thin layer above base python with a few dependencies added. Also, Scap can make changes to its CI a little easier from within its own repo.\n\n \u003e We probably want to generate the Sphinx doc and get it published to\n \u003e doc.wikimedia.org I recently refactored it but I cant quite\n \u003e remember off hand how to do it :/   That can be the subject of\n \u003e another change, the mediawiki/tools/releng repo just above has the\n \u003e publishing so that sounds like a good lead.\n\nNice, will look into that :)",

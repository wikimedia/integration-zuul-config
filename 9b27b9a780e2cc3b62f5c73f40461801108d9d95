      "message": "Ideally we would use the debian-glue job, but that looks like a restore of the previous job so we can let it in and refactor later.\n\n\nRegardless I think that job got removed because the .deb package was broken or kept breaking scap on beta.  But Mukunda would know more.\n\n\nCan you please split this to a different change?",

I would rather use the tox-docker template for now.\n\nWe probably want to generate the Sphinx doc and get it published to doc.wikimedia.org I recently refactored it but I cant quite remember off hand how to do it :/   That can be the subject of another change, the mediawiki/tools/releng repo just above has the publishing so that sounds like a good lead.",

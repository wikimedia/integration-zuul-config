      "message": "Yup there used to be a comment next to it: it is to use PHP 5.3. which is only on Precise.\n\nOnce we are happy with the composer jobs, we can duplicate them for each PHP flavor:  Precise -\u003e Zend 5.3 ,  Trusty -\u003e HHVM.\n\nBryan also told me of some utility that let you manage different PHP version in parallel from Travis CI but I lost the link/mail.  Using it we would get something like:\n\n magicphp --versions\u003d\"5.3,5.4,5.5,hhvm\" composer test\n\nOr something like that.",

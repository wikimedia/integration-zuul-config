      "message": "tests/test_zuul_project_in_gerrit.py has a test ensuring that projects defined in Zuul are in Gerrit.\n\nIt already has a function that retrieve the list of repositories (get_gerrit_repos()), the result is populated as a list in GERRIT_REPOS.   That will save a network access when running the test suite.\n\nYou might want to merge test_zuul_project_in_gerrit.py  and your code.  They both verify coverage.  Would make it easier to reuse the GERRIT_REPOS.",

# Jobs to build a Debian package using the set of shell scripts from
# http://jenkins-debian-glue.org/
#
# Merely a very useful wrapper / set of conventions around cowbuilder which on
# CI slaves are setup via the puppet module package_builder.
#
# Packages are build against the distribution mentionned in debian/changelog
# and we recognize the -wikimedia flavor such as 'jessie-wikimedia'.
#
# See upstream:

# Lintian checks packages for common errors. Generate a JUnit report that is
# then consumed by Jenkins Junit publisher plugin.

      "message": "That comments look a bit misleading. No one would ever run \"npm install\" on the production environment but instead use the Debian package.\n\nFrom T179552 the idea is to have the CI job to align with prod and use a Debian package (hence PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD).",

      "message": "docker-ci-src-setup-simple runs a container which fetch and checkout the patchset. It runs as the \"nobody\" user just like all CI containers.\n\nThe python snippet there is run on the host as user \"jenkins-deploy\" and it will not be able to run to src/config.yaml which is owned by \"nobody\".\n\n\nIn 2a890a16dddd0cfc7e94911b1435bc059b3cd32a we have added the executablePath option to config.prod.yaml  CI invokes service-runner which default to use config.yaml (a symlink to config-dev.yaml).\n\nReading the service-runner doc, its configuration system supports looking up environment variable:\n\n  field: \u0027{env(ENV_VAR_NAME[,default_value])}\u0027\n\nSo tentatively in config-dev.yaml we could add:\n\n puppeteer_options:\n  executablePath: \u0027{env(CHROME_BIN[,XXXX])}\u0027\n\nThe docker-registry.wikimedia.org/releng/npm-browser-test container already sets CHROME_BIN\u003d/usr/bin/chromium\n\nThe issue though is what to use for XXXX. If its empty the executablePath will be empty and I guess puppeteer will bails out trying to execute \u0027\u0027 :-(\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother possibility is to hack some code in chromium-render to have it set the executablePath whenever it detects it is running under CI. Typically JENKINS_URL environment variable would be set, but that makes it non obvious to reproduce locally since one has to remember which variable to set to trigger that code path :(",

      "message": "The jobs run the whole test suite but lot do not even hit the database.  It makes sense to run those databaseless tests with hhvm/zend, but makes little sense for the sqlite/mysql ones.\n\nWe used to run the tests split in batches based on groups. Maybe we need to split them again with database vs databaseless (see the group @database). So we would end up with:\n\n @database\n mysql  - hhvm\n mysql  - zend\n sqlite - hhvm\n sqlite - zend\n\n not @database\n hhvm\n zend\n\nThat is rather messy though :-\\",

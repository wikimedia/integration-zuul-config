That could be shipped in dockerfiles/bazel/ and use COPY to put it under /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n\n $ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list \n deb [arch\u003damd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt  stable jdk1.8\n\nB) the gpg key which should be committed in dockerfiles/bazel and we can COPY it as  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/bazel-release.asc\n\nThe key is at https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg\n\n\nThat gives us Bazel 0.23.0 :)",

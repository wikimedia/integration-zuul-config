It might consider a commit to vendor is more recent and not update the mediawiki/core.\n\nYou can give it a try though, refresh the job and retrigger it manually from https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/job/mediawiki-core-doxygen-publish/\n\nIf that works, lets land this patch.\n\n\nNext thing is that we should drop the scm: section entirely and instead use the builder \u0027zuul-cloner\u0027 to clone both projects.  Though they would be under  $WORKSPACE/src/ so the  mwcore-docgen.sh would have to be adjusted.",

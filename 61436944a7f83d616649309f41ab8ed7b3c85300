      "message": "Which means the quibble image no more has php7.2-gmp but it is needed for sure :]\n\nI think the mistake is that the quibble images are all based on releng/quibble-stretch which has:\n\n FROM {{ \"composer\" | image_tag }} as composer\n FROM {{ \"node10\" | image_tag }}\n\nThe composer image does inherit from php but the image is only used to copy /srv/composer into the quibble image.  The rest is not carried.\n\nThe actual base image for quibble-stretch is \"node10\" (which get us nodejs 10 and npm.\n\n\n\nEven if it worked, I would rather keep the package explicitly defined in the quibble images.  This way we ensure we always have it even when the parent containers get changed one way or another.",

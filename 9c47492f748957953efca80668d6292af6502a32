      "message": "Yeah that could work. We\u0027d save ourselves the extra time that would have been spent in `npm install` step with quibble too.\n\nI remembered that we might need to do something like this (dockerfiles/quibble-coverage/phpunit-junit-edit.py) for core also. We will also need to make sure we have the volume mounts set up properly so that the code coverage files have file paths that sonar-scanner can then resolve.",

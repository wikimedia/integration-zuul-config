      "message": "I don\u0027t think so. This is a 1:1 map of extensions to co-install when testing the subject.\n\nVisualEditor wants Cite (since it has code that runs conditional on Cite that we want to cover in the tests). And likewise Cite also installs VE alongside itself when being tested, since it has a VE plugin.\n\nActually, the VisualEditor-\u003eCite dependency is probably no longer needed. So that serves more as an integration test right now to make sure breaking changes require an update to be merged at the same time.",

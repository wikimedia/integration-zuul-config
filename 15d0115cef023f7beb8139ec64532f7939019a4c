Either the code:\n* is embedded in the extension repository (gave it a try with https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/183032/ )\n* added in a shared extension which is then added as a dependency and fetched by the job (ex: Mantle which holds code shared by Flow and MobileFrontend)\n* a git submodule, but the CI jobs do not fetch the submodules for now.",

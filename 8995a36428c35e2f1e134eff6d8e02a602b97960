      "message": "I\u0027m a little bit worried about always installing from that CRAN mirror fresh every time when we upload patches (because I\u0027m new to this stuff). How do other projects deal with this? (e.g. projects that use node.js?) Are they configured to use some WMF-hosted npm mirror (if there even is one)?\n\nWould it make sense to at some point get in touch with Ops on setting up our own CRAN mirror so we\u0027re not abusing other people\u0027s bandwidth?",
